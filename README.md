# Rock Mine Predictor ðŸª¨âš¡

A machine learning model to classify underwater objects as **rocks** or **mines** using sonar signal data.

## Overview
This project trains a binary classifier to distinguish between rocks and metal cylinders (mines) based on sonar reflections. Built with Python and scikit-learn, it demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation for a classic ML problem.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, normalization, and feature engineering.
- **Model Training**: Implements algorithms like Logistic Regression, SVM, or Random Forest.
- **Evaluation**: Metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC curves.

## Dataset
The model uses the [Sonar, Mines vs. Rocks](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Connectionist+Bench+(Sonar,+Mines+vs.+Rocks)) dataset from UCI ML Repository:
- **60 features**: Sonar signal frequencies.
- **Target**: `R` (Rock) or `M` (Mine).

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rock-mine-predictor.git
   cd rock-mine-predictor
